Inbox
=====

This app showcases how to use the APIs defined by the `SMInboxManager` and `SMInboxMessage` classes to create UI for a user inbox.

The main view shows a list of messages in the user's inbox, with titles and creation dates for each message. Unread messages are denoted with bold text and a white background, while read messages have regular text and a gray background.

Clicking on a message will show its body and give options for marking the message as "new" or "read", as well as deleting the message.
