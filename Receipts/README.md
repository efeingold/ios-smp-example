Receipts
========

This app showcases how to use the APIs defined by the `SMReceiptsManager`, `SMReceipt` and `SMReceiptUploadViewController` classes to allow users to upload receipt images.

The main view shows a list of receipts that have already been uploaded by the user. Clicking on a receipt tile will show the images that were included in that upload.

Clicking on the "+" symbol will give you the option to upload images for a new receipt. Follow the onscreen instructions to take a new photo or upload an existing image from your photo library.
