Rewards
=======

This app showcases how to use the APIs defined by the `SMRewardsManager`, `SMOffer`, `SMOrder`, `SMOrderRequest`, `SMSkillQuestion` and `SMSkillChallenge` classes to allow users to spend loyalty points to purchase rewards.

The "Offers" tab shows a list of offers that are available for purchase. Click on an offer to see more details and make a purchase. If the offer is gated by a skills test (e.g. for a sweepstakes entry), then an alert will appear with a random question. Enter the correct answer to complete the purchase.

The "Orders" tab shows a list of the user's order transactions and their approval statuses (e.g. "pending", "approved", "rejected").
