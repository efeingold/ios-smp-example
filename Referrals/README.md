Referrals
=========

This app showcases how to use the APIs defined by the `SMReferralsManager`, `SMReferral`, `SMReferralRequest`, `SMReferralsRequest` and `SMReferralError` classes to allow users to send an email to refer other portential users to sign up for an account.

The main view shows a list of referrals that have already been sent by the user. Clicking on a referral tile will show more details about the referral.

Clicking on the "+" symbol will give you the option to send a new referral. Fill out the presented form (note: only email is required) and click "Submit" to finish sending the referral.
