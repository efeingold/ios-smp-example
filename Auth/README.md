Authentication
==============

This app showcases how to use the APIs defined by the `SMIdentityManager` and `SMUserManager` classes to authenticate a user in the SessionM Platform.

On the "Choose Authentication Type" view, you can choose to authenticate a user with a SessionM Platform email and password, with a SessionM Platform authentication token, or with credentials from a third-party authentication provider such as Facebook or Google.

After selecting an authentication type, you can enter credentials to either authenticate an existing user or create a new one. After the user has been authenticated, you can see details about the user's account on the "User Info" view.
