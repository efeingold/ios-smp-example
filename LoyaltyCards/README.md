Loyalty Cards
=============

This app showcases how to use the APIs defined by the `SMLoyaltyCardsManager`, `SMLoyaltyCard` and `SMRetailer` classes to link and unlink loyalty cards to a user's account.

The main view shows a list of loyalty cards that have been linked to the user's account. Clicking on a card will give you the option to unlink the card from the user's account, after which the card will be removed from the list.

Clicking on the "+" symbol will give you the option to link a new card. Use the search bar to search for a retailer whose loyalty card you would like to link. After selecting the retailer, enter the card number and press the "Link" button to finish linking the card.
