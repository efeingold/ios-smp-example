This app showcases how to use the APIs defined by the `SMPlacesManager`, `SMPlace` and `SMCheckinResult` classes to allow users to earn points and promotional opportunities by checking in to sponsored venues.

The main view shows a list of sponsored venues available for check ins, along with how far the user is from each venue. Clicking on a venue will attempt to check the user in to that venue.
