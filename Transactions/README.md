Transactions
============

This app showcases how to use the APIs defined by the `SMTransactionsManager` and `SMTransaction` classes to view a user's loyalty points transaction history.

The main view shows a list of loyalty points transactions made by the user, and the resulting points balance after each transaction. "Receipt" and "Loyalty Card" transaction tiles can be clicked on to present an alert with more details on the transaction.
