Campaigns
=========

This app showcases how to use the APIs defined by the `SMCampaignsManager`, `SMMessage` and `SMFeedMessage` classes to fetch promotional campaign messages for presentation in an activity feed.

A message tile can be clicked to showcase its associated action (e.g. presenting an ad or opening a web page in Safari).
